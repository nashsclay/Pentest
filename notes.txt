for my script
/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service and add stop
download my script
Maybe and SCP script
sshuttle -r kali@<ip> -x <ip> 0/0 --ssh-cmd 'ssh -i <pemfile>'
maybe man pages for my notes already on git hub
To do for script
- add when script ends
- make whole script output to text file what we see for record
- put in different functions if possible (due to variables)
- add menu
all nmap scans include --reason
add https://<hostname>:8834 for easy access to nessus
